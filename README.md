# Blog First

* A simple, minimal, mobile first theme for Wordpress blogs

* INSTRUCTIONS FOR HACKERS...

* Mobile First: basic.css is called first, mobile.css is only called if the screenwidth is between 320px and 640px wide, desktop.css is called if the screenwidth is over 640px wide. You can edit those values in the header.php

* SASS/Compass: It's all in there and set up to edit, config.rb is in there too so just run a SASS watch or compile. 

* Uses Slim Starkers base, by Paul Adam Davis. Thanks!
