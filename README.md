# Blog First
* A minimal mobile first responsive theme for simple blogs
* basic.css is called first, mobile.css is only called if the screenwidth is between 320px and 640px wide, desktop.css is called if the screenwidth is over 640px wide.
* SASS/Compass is all there in /SASS if you'd like to use it, and a Compass config.rb is all set up
* Uses Slim Starkers base, by Paul Adam Davis. Love it!
